            <h2>Cloud services and servers</h2>
            <p>What Does it Do? (600 words)<br><br>

                Cloud services and servers is a very important widely used technology in our modern-day life. <br>
                Companies use cloud-based services for several reasons, but what are they and how are they useful?<br>
                If a company wanted to set up a computer system at their location they have a few options,<br> they can always buy all the physical equipment themselves and have everything
                 running in-house;<br> but there would be a large upfront cost to buy all that equipment not to mention the time it would take to get it all set up for use.<br>
                Therefore, a lot of companies like to use cloud computing services and servers.<br>
                If a company decides to go the cloud route, they do not have to buy anywhere near as much equipment<br> up-from and setup times for the system are extremely
                less than if they were to do it themselves.<br> With cloud-based systems, companies will pay a cloud services company to do all the work for them for the computer systems they need,<br>
                 this means no or very little on site setup and next to no maintenance for their systems,<br>
                  making cloud servers and services a no-brainer for most companies.<br>
                Now we have talked about why it is a good idea for most companies to use cloud servers and services, let us look at some more examples of cloud-based systems.<br><br>
                How do most companies store their data? <br>
                If you are a company that must store a lot of data, a server is what you need. Sometimes companies will have in-house servers,<br>
                 meaning the server that they use to back-up and store all their data is physically inside the location of the company or in some cases its own building entirely. <br>
                 This can be very expensive doing it this way as again you have all the upfront costs of buying all the equipment the physically build the system,<br>
                  onto of that you are also using that space for the servers that could alternatively be used for other reason thus making in-house servers physically inefficient.<br>

                Using cloud-based servers for you company is a very cost-efficient alternative to in-house server systems, <br>
                companies will pay cloud server companies to host their server for them therefore eliminating the cost of setup and maintenance <br>
                on their end as well as the space needed to physically have the servers installed and running; not to mention the money that is saved on the power bills.<br><br>
                
                Data loss<br><br>
                If a company has in-house servers for all their data, they will always be risking data loss. What happens if the hard drives fail?<br>
                 What if someone breaks in and steals some hard drives? What happens if there is a natural disaster such as a flood or a fire that ruins the system? The data is lost.<br>

                Therefore, companies love to use cloud-based servers to store their data, most cloud server providers have servers all over the world,<br>
                 or at least in multiple locations. If there is ever and issue with a location or hard drive going down the data is already backed-up somewhere<br>
                  else in another one of the locations that the provider has server’s setup. This is a very important and appealing perk if going with a cloud server provider for a company,<br>
                   knowing that they will not have to deal or worry about loss of data gives companies one less thing to worry about.<br><br>
                
                Maintenance<br><br>
                If a company has an in-house server setup then they are required to perform their own maintenance on their server system however,<br>
                 cloud server providers take care of the maintenance for their systems so customers never need to worry about maintaining a server system for their company.<br><br>
                
                What is the likely impact (300 words)<br><br>
                
                Cloud services and servers has a huge impact on small businesses and companies, even person use.<br>
                 Using cloud-based services has a massive positive financial impact on individuals, businesses, and companies alike.<br>
                  Let us look again at servers, there are huge cost benefits to not having to physically install and maintain in-house servers,<br>
                   no upfront costs of buying all the equipment and having to have someone install it all and set it all up.<br>
                    Maintaining your own system for a large company can be very expensive and frustrating if you do not have the required expertise in your company,<br>
                     because of this most companies must assign or hire staff just to maintain their systems or at least hire contractors to come in and fix a problem<br>
                      or update a system for them, costing the company more money every time something needs to be done.<br><br>

                In general, the world is moving away from local computing all together and moving towards having most of their systems and services based in the cloud.<br>
                 This is having a fantastic impact on how easy it can be to setup systems in general for companies and everyone making starting and building your own business<br>
                  must easier as far as the systems needed for storing your data, plus much more.<br>
                   Having systems based in the cloud is also very good for travelling and being able to access the same data or systems that you would usually<br>
                    need to be in your location of operations to access, being able to access all your data and your computer systems from anywhere in the world is a game changer<br>
                     for the industry and any industry that requires accessing data and systems from more than one location.<br><br>
                      Imagine the financial impact that it would have if people had to setup new systems at each physical location that you wanted to expand to,<br>
                       with cloud-based services you don’t have to worry about it as everything you need is already accessible no matter where you are.<br><br>

                
                How will this affect you? (300 words)<br><br>
                
                This already affects me, because of cloud services I can backup all my important data using DropBox.<br>
                 Wherever I am as long as I have a connection to the internet, I can access all my data I need to wherever I am, <br>
                 saving a lot of hassle having to manually move files and make sure before I go somewhere where I might need to access some data,<br>
                  I don’t have to worry about if I have remembered to copy everything I need before I go.<br>
                   I used to have to carry around a USB stick or a portable hard drive with games or music on it that I would need to access at friends houses or at band meetings etc,<br>
                    not if I need anything I can just sign into DropBox on my phone or any computer and download/view anything<br>
                     I need from there saving a lot of time and preventing a lot of mistakes remembering to bring things along.<br>

                This also help a lot when working in a team or a group or groups of people on projects and events, all the information such as press release kits,<br>
                 sheet music or schedules are all accessible online therefore, if I need to give somebody files or information it is already<br>
                  all stored on the cloud and they just need to be linked to access it, meaning I don’t have to manually upload all the files they need and e-mail them off to everyone involved<br>
                   who needs to access the files. Another awesome thing for me personally about using cloud services is that when I am recording must, <br>
                   I have set up my directory for my DAW as a Dropbox folder so when I am recording something, it is automatically backed up to Dropbox preventing any data loss if my<br>
                    system crashes or if I lose power. This saves a lot of time and stress, there are so many more reasons that cloud services help me in my life, <br>
                    this is just one of the most important reasons for myself personally.
