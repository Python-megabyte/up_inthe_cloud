                                                                   <p>After looking at the burning glass data I still think that being a penetration tester is my ideal job I coved in assignment<br>
                                                                     what sort of skills they were looking for and the areas of studies I would have to do to gain the skills needed for the job.<br>
                                                                      Communication is still the key baseline skill looked for in the IT field and is the skill I have closest to level required. </p>
