            <h2>Blockchain</h2>

            <p>
                A block chain is a group of information collected together forming a block but they can only storge so much so they get connected to the previous filled<br>
                 block creating a chain of data and when new data is added a new block is formed and connected this process repeats and continues indefinitely there are two<br>
                  main forms of blockchains private and public, Private where there is a single entry and can control membership usually used for business<br>
                   network and public where anyone can join validate their transaction. Blockchains make a tamper proof ledge of all transactions made but it not completely<br>
                    safe can still be attack through fraud and cyberattacks routing, phishing, stolen keys and code exploitation to name a few, but all these methods take a lot of<br>
                     time and rely heavily on human error to succeed. The main use of block chain now a days is for crypto currency which is a<br>
                      private decentralization blockchain, bitcoins need multiple computers to store their blockchains.<br>
                       The blockchain used bitcoins is a data base of all the transaction made but what make this different for other blockchains and decentralized<br>
                        is the fact the computers used are not all in the same locations and are controls / operated by a group of people or different individuals.<br>
                         A good way to think about it is a company would keep all its info on a group of serves in one place but with bitcoin<br>
                          the info is store over thousands of computers from all over the worlds forming a network the computers making up the network are called nodes.<br>
                           Each of these nodes are full of the data for all the trades and transactions. Having all these nodes means that if one has an error,<br>
                            it can correct itself by referring to all the others. Having the ability to self-correcting its code is very useful. <br><br>

                            Bitcoin open the path laid the groundwork for many other new and exciting block chains:<br><br>
                            •	BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) <br>
                            •	VC & SSI (Self Sovereign Identity)<br>
                            •	DeFi (Decentralized Finance)<br>
                            •	NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) <br>
                            •	CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)<br><br>
                            These are just a of the new developments happening right now at right now in the field of block chains I could write about any of these but<br>
                             the one I will focus on will be Central Bank Digital Currency.<br>
                              CBDC is heavily inspired but bitcoin but differs from crypto and virtual current by being issued by a state<br>
                               can be used as legal tender right now CBDC is a proof of concept but around 80% of centrals are interested digital currencies<br>
                                with China being the first to release one with RMB. A CBDC would likely happen by central bank, government or a privatized<br>
                                 sector using a data base controlled by them keeping a record how much money a person or a company has.<br>
                                  Another way it differs form a crypto currency would that it could be centrally control lessening the data need in it blockchain.<br>
                                   CBDC would be highly security and just like paper money a unique identical feature to stop it from being counterfeited.<br><br>

                            transactions could be made in real time meaning less risk for the sellers by having to waiting period between purchase and transfer of funds,<br>
                             with no need for the to track of complex transaction in with the customer says they paid but the money has not gone through yet.<br>
                              illegal acts could easily be traced, and trade and tax evasion would be way more difficult to do due to unreported employment,<br>
                               offshore bank account and money laundering all now having a clear trail of transaction and the money<br>
                                could return to anyone affected by these acts or any scams really. a record would provide a ledger to help with complicated tasks inheritance,<br>
                                 alimony or any transaction holding legal weight it would provide a modern alternative to cash stopping accidental loss of money<br>
                                  which would save the country hundreds of thousands each year. Adding a new type of banking system would cause competitions between banks<br>
                                   meaning perks for everyone free account, better interest rates making digital more attractive to everyday people and the more people<br>
                                    who join means more competition and the cycle continues. But there are a few risks centralization, digital dollarization<br>
                                     and banking system disintermediation. Since commercial banks are based on a fractional reserve system and a CDBC would be fully<br>
                                      reserved which could make people more likely to liquidizes their funds weaking commercial banks. Since most banks work off a centralized<br>
                                       system and bitcoins, blockchains are based off the idea of decentralization, CBDC might be tempted to use the system their more comfortable<br>
                                        with giving the bank the ability adds and remove money from anyone at will verse the self-correction of a decentralization block chain.<br>
                                         The last issue could arise from a foreign CBDC that is well running could replace a domestic current which could either provide a stable<br>
                                          competition with banks helping them convert or could cause a haemorrhaging of national funds.<br><br>
                            In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?<br>
                            In my opinion a CBDC would be a step in the right direction having the ability to make and receive transactions instantly would streamline daily life<br>
                             with getting paid and paying rent and with every transactions having a ledger doing taxes could be done instantly through the banks preventing accidently<br>
                              tax evasion I can see this helping everyone around me the people where it might hurt people are the elder it would be a double edge sword it would<br>
                               help them keep track of their money and help from getting scammed but it could be complicated for them to get anything but a basic understanding of how it works.
