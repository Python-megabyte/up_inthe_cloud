            <h2>Robots</h2>
            <p>
                What does it do? (600)<br><br>
At this stage of our time robotics are being developed to be an integral part of our society. For example, a small company called Hyundai Boston Dynamics<br>
 which was started by MIT in 1992 and now owned by the Hyundai Motor Group have developed quite amazing robots.<br>
  One of the robots already in the market is a robot calls Spot. Spot is a robotic dog that can navigate terrain with unprecedent mobility.<br>
   Spot allows companies to use this robot as a routine inspection companion. And I say companion because Spot is neither a human nor a tool like a computer.<br>
    Spot can be used in high security environments, dangerous work environments such as construction or rescue missions to assist in searching.<br>

The design of Spot has also been used in a television series called “War of the Worlds” where an alien civilization has released these robot dogs to attack humans.<br>
This brings up the question of the ethical standards of robotics and how they should be implemented. What rules should a robot follow? And what if a robot was developed<br>
 to have a mind or ability to make decisions for itself? We have all seen the film Terminator – an artificially intelligent robot from the future that travels<br>
  back in time to attack a woman's unborn son not once but twice with Terminator 2. In his science fiction book by Isac Asimov wrote about three important laws for<br>
   robotics which have become widely regarded as an important guide for those in the future who may develop a robot and artificial<br>
    intelligence capable of making its own free will and decisions.<br>
     These three laws are:<br><br>

First Law<br>
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br><br>

Second Law<br>
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br><br>

Third law<br>
A robot must protect its own existence if such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br><br>

Most interestingly these laws were used in the 1991 film iRobot where a robot was developed without the three laws of robotics and had a far more advanced brain<br>
 system allowing it to dream and even create artworks and even project or “feel” emotion. As the film progressed the other robots were controlled by a supercomputer<br>
  that went rogue and turned all other modern robotic law-abiding robots against humanity. In the end the robot with the three laws removed was set free and left to rule<br>
   over all remaining robots on the outskirts of the city. This raised the great question can robots and humans live in harmony?<br><br>
Robots are not going anywhere in fact Hyundai Boston Dynamics are also developing military grade robots that can also with stand heavy firepower<br>
 from an enemy without hurting a single human being. Their product still in development called Atlas is the world's most dynamic humanoid<br>
  robot and can even compete with fit athletic humans in agility and running and movement on almost any terrain. Atlas is still a research product<br>
   in development using hydraulic actuation with 28 different joints as well as an advanced LiDAR system for balance.<br>
    However, when Atlas becomes a mainstream product, our world will change. Some for the better and some for the worst. <br><br>

  
What is the likely impact (300)<br><br>

Robots will likely impact humanity in both a positive way and a negative way.<br>
 Firstly, in the negative way. Robots will take manual labor jobs from humans.<br>
  Trade positions like brick layers, builders, electricians, and retail positions such as retail assistants, booth operators on train stations, security guards,<br>
   and many other will cause the population to lose their jobs. However, it will be important for government to write laws that protect human jobs.<br>
    Hawaii state law makers in the US has voted to explore ways how to protect the population from robots taking jobs by introducing a universal income.<br><br>

While robots may have a negative impact on humanity there are also several positive ways that robots can help humans.<br>
The positive aspect of introducing robots means that humans can focus more on their health and wellbeing and allow robots to do all the<br>
 arduous work for us. Robots are already being developed in the medical field where extremely accurate lifesaving surgery can mean the difference between life and death.<br>
  The Da Vinci Systems robot allows doctors to perform these accurate robotic assisted minimally invasive surgeries and procedures reducing the risk of death or error by the surgeon.<br>

In addition to this, robots have already begin impacting manufacturing by using co-bots building our vehicles.<br>
 Transportation and shopping are already using drones to deliver order efficiently to customers reducing wait times to receive packages.<br>
  Amazon uses robots to search and prepare our orders in massive warehouses and brings the product to a human for packaging and delivery.<br>
   Soon we will see the introduction of robotic vehicles where no driver is present.<br>
    And this will allow governments to create better algorithms to reduce traffic jams and accidents in large cities. <br><br>


How will this affect you? (300)<br><br>

For me I see robots as an exciting future for humanity.<br>
 I believe that robots will make our lives better by helping us do the mundane tasks we do not always want to do or simply do not have time for.<br>
  For example, at home we may have a robot that cleans the floors mows the lawns and a robot that does the washing and general house cleaning.<br>
   As artificial intelligence becomes more advanced robots will be more like a personal home assistant rather than a machine that we turn on and off as we need. <br>

I see robots affecting me in a positive way as by the time I am near death a robot may well be taking care of me in my home during my last days.<br>
 The robot would be able to monitor my vitals and be able to report to my doctor in real time of my conditions.<br>
  The robot may also be able to prolong my life by working out the best level of exercise I should be doing and what foods and how much I should be eating to improve my health.<br>

I also see that robots will become a companion for humanity and assist us where we need help but at the same time laws will change.<br>
 Robots will also assist us with reaching the stars and help us to expand beyond earth and even the solar system.<br>
I believe robots will make my life easier and more efficient. And allow me to spend more time with my family and friends.
