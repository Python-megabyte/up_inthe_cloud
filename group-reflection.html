            <h2>
                Group Reflection
            </h2>
            <p>
                This group functioned well in my opinion we had slow start but that would be expected with this being our first group assignment<br>
                 and when we had to form the group most of us were bogged down with our Programming assignments but once we got started, we worked as<br>
                  well-oiled machine we delegate the work between us all focusing on our strengths and the areas we feel most comfortable.<br>
                   The part I found most surprising is how well we worked there was not a single agreement and when handed out the tasks for everyone<br>
                    no one complained we got everything done. The aspect we could have done better is our time management with a slow start and the time<br>
                     zone different between our team we had to do three weeks of work in one at a time that suited us all so we were limited in the times we could meet.<br>
                      I’ve learned working with this group we all worked well together unlike groups I work with in the past we all did our assigned<br>
                       parts and we all got along cant wait to keep working with them. <br>

                       In overall as a team we have accomplished our team goal within the time limit given. As a team we believe that completing an assignment in<br>
                        time is the most important fact to us. Further, team effort that everyone put through the completion of assignment is the other most critical success factor.<br>
                         Diversified skills set of team members further facilitate to good quality work.  <br>

                        Further considering about improvement point, as a team we struggled with compiling finalized tasks which are allocated to group members.<br>
                         Eve though it takes significant amount of time as a team we managed to mitigate the barriers. <br>

                        The Surprising fact was, the technology that facilitate us to teamed together to achieve this team goal.<br>
                         Our team members from different states in Australia and from the US as well. Different time frame different continents are not barriers anymore. <br>

                        As a team, by completing this assignment we all realized that the team work facilitate to bring different skills set to one place.<br>
                         Further knowledge sharing is the other most important fact.  <br>

                        Moreover git-hub sophisticated technology platform provided us best support to complete this assignment. <br>

                        Everyone in the group was easy to have a student team relationship with and we were able to quickly build a strong repour. <br>
                        At first it was difficult to work out a schedule with the team and we lost two weeks of work time. We were able to evenly delegate <br>
                        the workload throughout passing the torch to lessen the workload on each other or place too much work on one person.<br>
                         For me, using Microsoft Teams as a learning tool was a great experience. It was a seamless classroom like experience and was as<br>
                          though we were really in a classroom session. At first, it was difficult to work around each other's schedules,<br>
                           however we were able to be pro-active and work out a time that suited all of us to be online.<br>
                            The most surprising part of this for me was that the team was still able to work with me while I am overseas in New York.<br>
                             Working on groups showed me that while I may have some ideas about a given subject, working in groups allowed me to see concepts<br>
                              from a unique perspective and be able to develop ideas to be far more developed and coherent. <br>

                              Working as a team has helped me to develop my my skills working in an online business setting.<br>
                               Since I am interested in working as a developer from home, being able to get exposure to work with new people<br>
                                online has given me more confidence in meeting with clients when it come time to develop their projects. <br>
                                Development is one part but another and very important part is being able to communicate and do business online. <br>
                              I think we all got along well as a team and we’re open to discussion without conflict we all knew there was no time for that.<br>
                               In terms of improvements we could have started to meet earlier and that would have given us more time to improve the finer details of our project.<br>
                                However we did do a good job with the little time we had. <br>
                              A surprising part of this project was having one student overseas and this meant that we all had to coordinate at<br>
                               a time where we were ill awake and online or available. Surprisingly we were also able to do this even with all our personal schedules.<br>
