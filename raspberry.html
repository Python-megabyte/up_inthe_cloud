            <h2>Raspberry Pi, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</h2>
            <p>
                What does it do? (600 words)<br>
                 What is the state of the art of this new technology?<br><br>
                The First computer was as big as a room and comes with a memory less than a microwave.<br> But 
                things are change now. The gradual development of Information and Technology makes world more <br>
                smaller and everyone can access the world with their fingertips. Also evaluation of hard ware, <br>
                convert devices size in to mega to micro.<br><br>
                Using Single board computers, single board microcontrollers and invention kits technologies <br>
                Raspberry Pi, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices are reshaping the IT <br>
                world and this is the new era of electrical and computer engineering.<br> 
                 Presently, Arduino, Raspberry pi and Makey Makeys are most popular electronic <br>
                hardware kits among the projects and the user community. Those silent, energy efficient, simple and <br>
                low cost hard ware kits are giving opportunity to any non-engineer person to use them on their <br>
                creating digital projects. Let’s discussed about those three giants general information and technical <br>
                specifications. <br><br>
                1. Arduino – Arduino is an open source hard ware and software company. They designs and <br>
                manufactures single board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices <br>
                projects and user community. Arduino board design use a variety of microprocessors and <br>
                controllers. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages. <br>
                Using a standard API which is also known as the “Arduino Language”.<br><br>
                2. Raspberry pie-Raspberry pie is a series of small single board(SBCs)developed by in the UK by <br>
                Raspberry Pi Foundation. This Project Originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic <br>
                computer science in school and in developing countries. It provides Raspbian OS and as well as third <br>
                parties OS. Also it promotes python and scratch as main languages.3. Makey Makeys- Makey Makey-An Invention Kit for Everyone.This is an invention kit designed <br>
                to connect everyday objects to computer keys. Using a circuit board, alligator clips, and a USB cable, <br>
                the toy uses closed loop electrical signals to send the computer either a keyboard stroke or mouse <br>
                click signal. This function allows the Makey Makey to work with any computer program or webpage <br>
                that accepts keyboard or mouse click inputs and then it will work.<br><br>
                What can be done now? <br><br>
                The use of those new technologies spread in a vast area. Also during the coronavirus pandemic, <br>
                Raspberry Pi computers saw a large increase in demand primarily due to the increase in working <br>
                from home. Home automation make our day to day life easy and efficient through with above <br>
                technologies. Domestic automated cleaning robots ,functional mirrors are few examples. Industrial <br>
                automation use this applications and hardware for most modern cars and electric vehicles . <br>
                Education and research sector get huge benefits from Raspberry pi and Arduino app. A platforms for <br>
                hands on integrated learning of computing science, technology, engineering and mathematics with <br>
                robotics open new windows to future learners. Researchers use this app in a data loggers for <br>
                scientific research. Soon future it will be available on all the industries.<br><br>
                What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?<br><br>
                Recently, Nasa’s open source rover powered by a Raspberry pi 3 and it gives us a good sign of how <br>
                those technologies will apply to air space projects in the future. Low cost ,high performance <br>
                computers availability people will use to learn ,solve and have fun. It will make up connection <br>
                between IT communities and new learners. People’s IT literacy will grow around the world without <br>
                boundaries. Developing countries will be more beneficial from this. In near future every commercial <br>
                products will be automotive. It will increase the work efficiency ,work quality of the commercial <br>
                industry. Drone development will play key role in the society. From security job to delivery job will <br>
                be done by open source powered drones. <br><br>
                What technological or other developments make this possible?<br><br>
                People never thought when mobile phone arrived, it will be their future. Now smart phone has <br>
                become our hands on life remote controller. So next level of those technologies development will be <br>
                in our smart phones. People will be live in a smart world and home will convert in to smart digital <br>
                place.<br><br>
                What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is <br>
                likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make <br>
                redundant any current jobs or technologies? <br><br>
                Raspberry Pi, Arduinos ,Makey Makeys and other small computing devices technologies will likely <br>
                impact society in both positive and negative ways. Firstly in positive way this is a new era for the <br>
                humans. Availability of low cost technology gives fair rights to all human on the earth to access new <br>
                technology .It breaks the wall between development countries and developing countries. Through <br>
                this people will more socialize as a IT communities. It helps to share their ideas and it will be a great <br>
                stage to all the individuals and groups to perform their creativity. Those new innovations can use to <br>
                develop the quality of human society. Also it powers the isolated communities to find the solution <br>
                for their own problem by using new technology. When we looks back, human activities did <br>
                enormous damage to the nature. Global heat ,sea pollution ,deforestation and so on. those <br>
                technologies give us a chance to heal the world and fix the problem.<br>
                 For an example we can develop a drone to grow plants in deforestation areas. AI can monitor it.<br>
                 Robots can use to clean the sea 
                using a AI system which detect garbage in the sea. Renewable energy is a big topic all over the world 
                .<br>
                This technology has a answer for it. Through this technologies mega task can break down in to <br>
                individual self-defend units and most of the time they use solar or lithium batteries. It will stops coal <br>
                burning in the power station.<br><br>
                Even though it gives solution to some problems it gives negative impact to labour market. Specially <br>
                unskilled and low level jobs will be unavailable due to replacement of software powered small <br>
                devices. For an example security jobs ,cleaning jobs, delivery jobs, packing jobs and more. So IT <br>
                literacy will be a important fact in the future. In other hand electronic waste can be a huge problem <br>
                to the environment .Many objects in daily life will be attached with a single board mini circuit. There<br>
                for there is a huge possibility to land filled with this waste. Authorities need to have a solution to <br>
                sort it out. Recycling and use ecofriendly materials will be a better option for it.<br><br>
                How will this affect you? (300 words)<br><br> In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be <br>
                different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends? <br>
                As I see single board computers and open source powered micro control board will change our <br>
                future. I’m always amazed with use of these technologies and I’m really enjoying it. I believe, as a IT <br>
                student it is a crucial to update with these new technologies. My life will be pretty much easy and I <br>
                will use them for my day to day activities. Studying online and working in a full time job is not easy. <br>
                Due to busy situation I always forget about bill payments ,groceries and some task which I promise <br>
                to do my family. I hope that smart environment will find solution to balance my life. Living with <br>
                smart digital system will help to plan, organize my day to day life. It will give me stress free mind <br>
                and it will improve my mental health. Also if it can monitor my health concerns, my food and water <br>
                intakes I can maintain a healthy life style which benefits my body. In other hand it gives me chance <br>
                to spend more quality time with my family and friends and It improves our human bond to each <br>
                other.
